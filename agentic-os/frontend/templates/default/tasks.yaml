    Resolve only issue #2 from the issues list.


    1. Start by running all the unit-tests and capturing their success/failure
    state. Share the result using the tool "share_thoughts".


    2. After analyzing, make sure you fully understand the root cause of the
    problem. When you get clarity of an issue's root cause and what needs to be
    done, share your thoughts (via tool "share_thoughts").


    3. Align to the guidelines provided by the scanning tool in the issue. 


    4. When you make changes:


    a) Make the minimal needed focused change, do not address anything unrelated
    to the exact issue at hand. 


    b) When updating a file with "write_file" tool, always print the entire
    complete full updated file, never ever leave things like "unchanged code
    omitted for brevity"!


    c) Code removal:

    - Don't remove any existing code comment. 

    - Don't remove code you do not fully understand why it is needed.

    -  When removing segment of code and not replacing it, better comment that
    part out instead.

    - If the amount of lines in the file after your changes decreases in more
    than a few lines, it is usually as bad sign you did something wrong.


    d) Make absolutely certain the fix does not break anything.


    e) Always try to apply a fix as early as possible in the program flow rather
    than just bandage where the symptom is.


    f) Document in code comments any change you make.


    5. Before declaring the work as complete, you must run again all the
    unit-tests and compare the results with the first time, then make sure there
    is no regression (no test that passed before now fails). Share the result
    and the summary using the tool "share_thoughts".
