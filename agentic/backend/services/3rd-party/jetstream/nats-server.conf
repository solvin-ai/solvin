# -----------------------------------------
# NATS Standalone JetStream Configuration
# -----------------------------------------

# Name of this server (for logs/monitoring)
server_name: "nats-js-single"

# Main client port
port: 4222

# HTTP monitoring endpoints
http_port: 8222

# JetStream configuration block
jetstream {
  # Where JetStream will store state (make sure to mount this path as a volume if using Docker)
  store_dir: /data/jetstream

  # Limits for in-memory and on-disk storage (adjust if needed)
  max_mem_store: 1Gb
  max_file_store: 10Gb
}

# Optional logging (uncomment if you want more debug info)
# debug: true
# trace: true
# logtime: true

# --- NO CLUSTER BLOCK! ---
#
# This config intentionally has NO "cluster { ... }" section.
# That ensures NATS runs in standalone mode,
# so JetStream works without requiring cluster routes.

# --- Optional: Authorization (add for securing your server) ---
# authorization: {
#   users = [
#     { user: "demo", password: "password123" }
#   ]
# }

# --- Optional: TLS (add for encrypted connections) ---
# tls {
#   cert_file: "/etc/nats/certs/server-cert.pem"
#   key_file:  "/etc/nats/certs/server-key.pem"
#   ca_file:   "/etc/nats/certs/ca.pem"
# }
